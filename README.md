# Apple Watch Data Exploration (Work in Progress)

As a data enthusiast, I am always looking for ways to gain insights through data. After purchasing an Apple Watch as a gift to myself last year, I saw an opportunity to explore personal health metrics in depth. Recently, I exported the data from my Apple Watch, resulting in a 250MB XML file. This dataset provides a wealth of information, and I am excited to analyze it further.

## Dataset Overview

The `export.xml` file extracted from the Apple Watch data contains multiple sections, primarily divided into the following categories:

### 1. Health Records
This section contains all health-related data, represented by various `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier` objects. It includes metrics such as:
- Energy burned
- Heart rate
- Stand time
- Body mass

These records correspond to the data visible in the Apple Health app.

### 2. Workout Records
The workout data is captured through `HKWorkoutActivityType` objects. This includes key workout parameters from the Apple Fitness app, such as:
- Workout type
- Duration
- Distance
- Energy burned

### 3. Daily Summary Data
The daily summary data is pulled from the Activity app and provides a breakdown of daily targets versus actual metrics for:
- Move goals
- Exercise time
- Stand hours

Due to privacy concerns, I won’t be sharing the full dataset here, but snippets and examples will be shown in the code.

## Notebooks (Work in Progress)

### 1. Apple Watch Export Data Extraction
This notebook demonstrates how to extract the data from the XML export file and convert it into structured formats such as pandas DataFrames and CSV files for further analysis.

### 2. Heart Rate Data Exploration and Analysis
This notebook focuses on exploring heart rate data. It analyzes the differences between heart rate metrics such as:
- Resting heart rate
- Walking heart rate
- Overall heart rate patterns

It also examines variations in heart rate across different times of day and between weekdays and weekends.

### 3. Energy Data Exploration and Analysis
This notebook delves into the energy data, particularly understanding the distinction between:
- Basal energy burned
- Active energy burned

It explores trends in energy expenditure over time, as well as patterns by time of day and day of the week.

## Open Questions

Several research questions guide this analysis, including:

1. **Heart Rate Analysis:**  
   - What are the typical patterns of my heart rate?
   - How does my heart rate differ when resting, walking, or during workouts?

2. **Energy Burn Analysis:**  
   - How has my energy expenditure changed, especially as I’ve increased my daily move targets over time?
   - What is the relationship between heart rate and energy burned?

3. **Weekday vs. Weekend Patterns:**  
   - How do my health metrics differ between weekdays and weekends?

4. **Workout Trends:**  
   - How are my workout sessions evolving over time?
   - Am I playing longer (e.g., using Ring Fit Adventure on the Nintendo Switch for the past three months)?
   - Am I becoming more accustomed to workouts by analyzing trends in heart rate and energy burned during exercise?

## Conclusion
This ongoing exploration seeks to uncover patterns in personal health data collected from my Apple Watch. By examining heart rate, energy expenditure, and workout data, I aim to gain deeper insights into my health habits and lifestyle trends over time. Stay tuned for updates as this project progresses.
